# whitehatscrat

This is a decripter made for my school project at my grade 11

It is a simple game made out of pygame moudle in python quite famous one!
the idea is something like this and object or may be in the game a fruit falls down particularly nut in this one and
the objective is to catch the nut by using the arrow keys on the keyboard.
  The cool thing about the game is that when you complete this game by getting some threshold scores you can decript a file which is already encripted by using a
different scirpt file.
and that is pretty much everything about the game :)
